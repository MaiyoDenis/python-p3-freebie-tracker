# Freebie Tracker

This project is a Freebie Tracker application that manages companies, developers (devs), and freebies given by companies to devs. It uses a relational database to store information about these entities and their relationships.

## Entities and Relationships

The application models three main entities:

- **Company**: Represents a company that can give freebies to developers. Each company has an ID, name, and founding year.
- **Dev**: Represents a developer who can receive freebies from companies. Each dev has an ID and a name.
- **Freebie**: Represents a free item given by a company to a developer. Each freebie has an ID, item name, value, and foreign keys linking it to a dev and a company.

### Relationships

- A **Company** can give many **Freebies** (one-to-many).
- A **Dev** can receive many **Freebies** (one-to-many).
- There is a many-to-many relationship between **Company** and **Dev** through the **Freebie** association.

                            | company_id (FK)|
                            +----------------+
```

- The lines indicate relationships:
  - One Company can have many Freebies.
  - One Dev can have many Freebies.
  - Freebie acts as a join table linking Companies and Devs.

## Usage

The application allows you to:

- Track companies and their founding years.
- Track developers.
- Record freebies given by companies to developers.
- Query relationships such as which freebies a dev has received or which devs a company has given freebies to.
